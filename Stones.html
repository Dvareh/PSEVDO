 		<td id="First1">The Mind Stone was one of the six Infinity Stones, the remnant of a singularity that predated the universe, which governed over the fabric of mind. It was previously wielded by Loki inside his Scepter who received it as a gift from Thanos for the Chitauri Invasion. After the Battle of New York, the Scepter was confiscated by HYDRA, whose scientists used it to give extraordinary powers to the twins Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. After the fall of HYDRA, the Scepter was recovered by the Avengers. It was taken by Ultron and its blue gem casing was shattered, releasing the stone inside it and placing it on the being that would become Vision. It remained with Vision until it was forcibly removed by Thanos following the Battle of Wakanda, killing Vision in the process. It was then destroyed along with the other five stones by Thanos after the Infinity War. </td>

 		<td id="Firs1">TThe Power Stone was a powerful weapon capable of granting a person with great, cosmic power, but was highly likely to kill any organic beings that touch it. It was used by Eson the Searcher until it was hidden for millennia on the planet Morag inside the Orb.The Orb containing the Power Stone was coveted by Thanos, who employed the Kree warrior Ronan the Accuser in 2014 to retrieve it for him. However, before Ronan could acquire the Orb, it was stolen by Star-Lord, prompting a galaxy-wide hunt that resulted in the Orb being given to the Nova Corps for safe-keeping.  </td>

Housed within the Tesseract, over the course of history it was wielded by many individuals, including Johann Schmidt of HYDRA, Mar-Vell of the Kree Empire, the Skrulls, and Loki of Asgard. During the Infinity War, the Tesseract was shattered by Thanos, who put the Space Stone inside his Infinity Gauntlet. After Thanos successfully wiped out half of life, he destroyed the Space Stone, along with the other Infinity Stones to prevent his work being undone.  </td>
